Different types of errors can occur while coding or while running a program.

1. Syntax Errors: 
* These errors are a problem of the programmer because he/she might be writing a wrong code which causes program to crash. 
* Very easily resolved by the programmer since compiler provides warnings.

2. Logical Errors:
* The code is syntactically perfect, but if the code doesn't perform the same function that the programmer intended it to, then such errors are logical.
* Compiler doesn't give warnings but it can be resolved by Debugger.

3. Runtime Errors:
* These are errors occurring at the client's end. The client may have put improper data/ not provided resources required for the code to run etc.
* They are called exceptions because they are unaccounted for.
